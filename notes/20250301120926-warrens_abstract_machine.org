#+title: Warren's Abstract Machine

#+begin_quote
The WAM is an abstract machine consisting of a memory architecture and
instruction set tailored to Prolog. It can be realised efficiently on a wide
range of hardware, and serves as a target for portable Prolog compilers. It has
now become accepted as a standard basis for implementing Prolog.
