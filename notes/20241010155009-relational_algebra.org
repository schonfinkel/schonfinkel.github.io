* JOIN

#+begin_quote
Returns a relation containing all possible tuples that are a combination of two
tuples, one from each of two specified relations, such that the two tuples
contributing to any given result tuple have common values for the common
attributes of the two relations (and those common values appear just once, not
twice, in that result tuple). Note: This kind of join was originally called the
natural join, to distinguish it from various other kinds—especially the so
called θ-join (“theta join”).
