In larger projects, we don't want to run the compiler or clean up
manually. Instead, we want to use a build system to automatically find and link
in libraries. OCaml has a legacy build system called ocamlbuild, and a newer
build system called [[id:ec5997ac-fe15-4e3e-ba6e-d50c7675210f][Dune]]. [cite:@clarkson2025ocaml p.30]
