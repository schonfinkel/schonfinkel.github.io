The \pi-calculus differs from other models of communicating behaviour mainly in
its treatment of mobility. The movement of a piece of data inside a computer
program is treated exactly the same as the transfer of a message - or indeed an
entire computer program - across the internet. One can also describe networks
which reconfigure themselves.

The calculus is very simple but powerful. Its most prominent notion is that of a
name, and it has two important ingredients: the concept of behavioural (or
observational) equivalence, and the use of a new theory of types to classify
patterns of interactive behaviour.
