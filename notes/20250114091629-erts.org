* The Erlang Node

#+begin_quote
When you start an [[id:8d568d81-9c22-4d94-81b2-27a2d730ba98][Elixir]] or [[id:de7d0e94-618f-4982-b3e5-8806d88cad5d][Erlang]] application or system, what you really start
is an Erlang node. The node runs the Erlang RunTime System and the virtual
machine BEAM. [cite:@beambook]

* The Scheduler

#+begin_quote
One of the nice things that Erlang does for you is help with the physical
execution of tasks. (...), if extra CPUs (or cores or hyperthreads) are
available, Erlang uses them to run more of your concurrent tasks in parallel. If
not, Erlang uses what CPU power there is to do them all a bit at a time.
