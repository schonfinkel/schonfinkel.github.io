[[id:0fc0b1d1-71f2-475f-b326-edc22be2c2c5][OAuth 2]] provides a framework for authorizing applications to call APIs, but
isn’t designed for authenticating users to applications. The OpenID Connect
(OIDC) protocol provides an identity service layer on top of OAuth 2, designed
to allow authorization servers to authenticate users for applications and return
the results in a standard way. Some implementations of OAuth 2 added proprietary
additions to do this, but a standard solution was needed. In this chapter, we’ll
describe the problem OIDC solves in more detail and how an application can use
OIDC to authenticate a user.
