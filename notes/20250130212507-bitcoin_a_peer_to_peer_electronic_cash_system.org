#+begin_quote
[[id:2f706a90-c7cb-4bff-ad7e-f273c0857480][Bitcoin]] was first described in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", written under the alias of
Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto combined several prior inventions
such as digital signatures and Hashcash to create a completely decentralized
electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency
issuance or settlement and validation of transactions. A key innovation was to
use a distributed computation system (called a "proof-of-work" algorithm) to
conduct a global lottery every 10 minutes on average, allowing the decentralized
network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions.
