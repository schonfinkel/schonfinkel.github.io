The [[id:6ed3a191-0128-453e-b0b6-37c48593a6f0][OTP]] system comes packaged with a customizable error logger. We can look at
the error logger from three points of view. The programmer view concerns the
function calls that programmers make in their code in order to log an error. The
*configuration view* is concerned with where and how the error logger stores its
data. The *report view* is concerned with the analysis of errors after they have
occurred. [cite:@armstrong2013 p.382]
