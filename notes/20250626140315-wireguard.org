WireGuard is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, implemented as a
kernel virtual network interface for [[id:8a427ee7-2ef1-489b-af82-91de7be8a3ba][Linux]], which aims to replace both IPsec for
most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or TLS-based solutions like
OpenVPN, while being more secure, more performant, and easier to use.
