#+title: Distributed Computing Through Combinatorial Topology

The essential properties of [[id:d7efb05f-fb8f-438c-b09d-ea91dc24ebc3][Distributed Systems]]:

+ *Local views*. First, each process has only a local view of the current state of
  the world. That is, a process is uncertain about the views of the other
  processes.

+ *Evolution of local views*. Second, processes communicate with one
  another. Each communication modifies local views. If they communicate
  everything they know and the communication is flawless and instantaneous, they
  end up with identical local views, eliminating uncertainty. The systems we
  study are interesting precisely because this is usually not the case, either
  because processes communicate only part of what they know (for efficiency) or
  communication is imperfect (due to delays or failures).
