* History

C was first described in 1978 by Kernighan and Ritchie in the book "The C
Programming Language" [cite:@kernighan1988c]. It is now defined by revisions of
the ISO/IEC 9899 standard (ISO/IEC 2024) and other technical specifications. The
C standards committee is the steward of the C programming language, working with
the broader community to maintain and evolve the C language
