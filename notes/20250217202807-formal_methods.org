#+title: Formal Methods

#+begin_quote
The term "formal methods" refers to various mathematical techniques used for the
formal specification and development of software. They consist of a formal
specification language and employ a collection of tools to support the syntax
checking of the specification, as well as the proof of properties of the
specification. They allow questions to be asked about what the system does
independently of the implementation.

The use of mathematical notation avoids speculation about the meaning of phrases
in an imprecisely worded natural language description of a system. Natural
language is inherently ambiguous, whereas mathematics employs a precise rigorous notation.
