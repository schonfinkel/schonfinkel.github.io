After implementing a pipelined top-N query to retrieve the first page
efficiently, you will often also need another query to fetch the next pages. The
resulting challenge is that it has to skip the rows from the previous
pages. There are two different methods to meet this challenge: firstly the
*offset method*, which numbers the rows from the beginning and uses a filter on
this row number to discard the rows before the requested page. The second
method, which I call the *seek method*, searches the last entry of the previous
page and fetches only the following rows.
