<p>
Scheduling your O3s is actually more important than having them weekly. That's
why it's first on our list. It is more important

<p>
Weekly It is best to conduct your One On Ones on a weekly basis. The simplest
reason for this is that you probably think about your work life in weekly
increments.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How DO you “stay in touch” with those in your organization who
are “below” your directs? First, insist on your subordinate
managers doing One On Ones with their directs. Your
immediate subordinate managers are responsible for their
relationships with their directs. The way you maintain your
relationship with your skips (and even levels below that, if it
applies to you) is by keeping a strong relationship with your
directs and relying on them to maintain relationships with theirs.
Any other model for this just doesn't scale.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that you won't be able to have the same
relationship with people who are two or more levels down from
you. You won't, but it's okay, because you're not supposed to.
Efforts to do so are a waste of your most precious resource as a
manager: your time. Build an organization of effective managers

<blockquote>
<p>
The second critical manager behavior that leads to results and retention is
communicating about performance.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
When the average manager gives feedback, the focus is on what happened. The
manager thinks about what happened in the past and asks herself how to talk to
the direct—about what happened, in the past, about which the manager can do
nothing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you don't point out mistakes frequently, your directs assume that, when you
do choose to talk to them, they think it's because they may be “in trouble.”
Their defensiveness, then, should not be surprising.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb1ab035">
<blockquote>
<p>
The moment you switch to a future focus, however, you free yourself up to focus
on something that you (and they) can do something about. <b>Regardless of whether
your direct was ineffective or effective this morning, the true purpose of any
performance communication about either situation is exactly the same: you want
more effective behavior in the future</b>. If your direct made a mistake, you want
different behavior. If your direct did something well, you want more of the
same.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Manager Tools Feedback Model has four simple steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ask: Ask your direct if you can give then some feedback. Also, it's an
important managerial rule to <b>never ask a question of your directs if you
don't intend to honor their answer</b>.</li>
<li><p>
State the Behavior: How should one pass it's messages to one's peers.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The words you say: The words you choose to say out loud to others are a</li>
</ul>
<p>
choice, and different words produce different results. <b>Your choice of words
makes a difference in business results</b>. Furthermore, certain words are known
to produce distinctly better results in certain situations.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to say words: Watch your tone, tenor and inflection.</li>
<li>Your facial expressions: Non-verbal language actually accounts for most of
the perceived meaning in normal conversations.</li>
<li>Body language: Same as above.</li>
<li>Work product: What you do and how well you do your job are behaviours as well.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Quantity</li>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Timeliness</li>
<li>Documents</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are is template on how to start: "When you &lt;behavior&gt;&#x2026;", for instance:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"When you are ahead of schedule&#x2026;"</li>
<li>"When you stay an extra hour to find the root cause&#x2026;"</li>
<li>"When you respond politely after the customer insults you&#x2026;"</li>
<li>"When you make that extra call to keep the customer informed&#x2026;"</li>
<li>"When you promise it to me yesterday but don't deliver&#x2026;"</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Would you rather have a 15-second negative feedback
discussion or a two-minute negative feedback discussion with
your boss? Shorter is better. Saying “When you” will help you be

<li><p>
State the Impact of the Behavior
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(&#x2026;) effective feedback isn't about waiting until there's a pattern, and it
doesn't get better with age. And wouldn't you rather know sooner rather than
later that there's a problem?
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Encourage Effective Future Behavior
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When we are giving negative feedback, we are asking the direct to behave
differently. <b>We're not punishing the past mistake, because we've already
forgiven it. Remember that our focus is on the future, not the past</b>.

<h3 id="org8079ef7">When should I give feedback</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8079ef7">
<p>
Feedbacks should be given as early and often as possible, if you can give
feedback right after noticing positive/negative behaviour that's ideal, of
course, make sure you do so without others overhearing.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you keep in mind that sooner is better and that there's no appreciable
decline in value during the first three to five days, you have a lot more time
and a lot more opportunities to deliver what it is your directs want—and tell us
they want.

What do I do if one of my directs pushes back or refuses feedback? If your
direct is defensive it means they likely know they're in the wrong. Do not drag
a conflict from the past and focus on the future.

<blockquote>
<p>
Systemic feedback changes what you are talking to your direct about and raises
the level of consequences associated with a continued failure to
change. Systemic feedback addresses the direct's combination of continued
failure to change with the direct's stated commitment to change. It addresses
the greater failure to meet a repeated commitment. Failure to meet commitments
is a systemic failure that no organization can long
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Here is the fundamental difference. Standard feedback is about small
behaviors. Systemic feedback addresses the moral hazard of a direct committing
to new behavior but then failing to follow through. We can tolerate directs who
make mistakes. We cannot tolerate directs who repeatedly make commitments they
don't keep.
