This thesis describes a system for software deployment called [[id:72d705ae-9f5c-402b-88e5-21744277319a][Nix]] that addresses
many of the problems that plague existing deployment systems. In this
introductory chapter I describe the problem of software deployment, give an
overview of existing systems and the limitations that motivated this research,
summarise its main contributions, and outline the structure of this thesis.
