#+title: Aristotle's Categories

* Substance and Accidents

#+begin_quote
Aristotle proposed an ultimate categorization of all the different ways
something can exist. The first distinction he made, coming just by reflection on
ordinary experience, is that there are some entities that are able to exist “in
themselves” and other entities that can only exist “in others”. (...). In other
words, common experience tells us there are both things and modifications of
things. In philosophical terminology, these are called *substances* and *accidents*
respectively. [cite:@sullivan2006introduction p.32]
