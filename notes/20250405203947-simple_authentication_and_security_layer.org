#+begin_quote
The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for providing
authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols via
replaceable mechanisms. SASL provides a structured interface between protocols
and mechanisms. SASL also provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol
exchanges within a data security layer. [cite:@rfc4422 p.1]
