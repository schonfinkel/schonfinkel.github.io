Datalog is a declarative query language for relational databases based on the
[[id:1a477871-5172-46c1-af5e-461de148ebf0][Logic Programming]] paradigm. From a syntactical standpoint, an important
difference between Datalog and logic programs is that function symbols are not
allowed in Datalog. One of the peculiarities that distinguishes Datalog from
query languages like [[id:11914357-b272-40fc-8bf6-a0ff98af0c99][Relational Algebra]] and calculus is recursion, which gives
Datalog the capability to express queries like computing a graph transitive
closure.
