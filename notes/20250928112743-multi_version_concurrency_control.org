MVCC dictates that, instead of modifying an existing tuple within the database,
the system has to replicate the tuple, apply the changes, and invalidate the
original one. You can compare this to the ~copy-on-write~ mechanism used in
operating filesystems such as [[id:519e11ea-6d0f-4b1e-8edf-fd109ffd4677][ZFS]].
