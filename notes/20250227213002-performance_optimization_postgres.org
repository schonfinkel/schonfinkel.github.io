* The ~EXPLAIN~ Statement

#+begin_quote
There are a few important things to know before using ~EXPLAIN~:
+ It will only show the best plan, which is the one with the lowest cost among
  all the evaluated plans.
+ It will not execute the statement you are asking the plan for, at least unless
  you explicitly ask for its execution. Therefore, the ~EXPLAIN~ execution is fast
  and pretty much constant each time. 
+ It will present you with all the execution nodes that the executor will use to
  provide you with the dataset.
