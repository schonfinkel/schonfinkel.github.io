#+title: Subqueries (SQL)

+ Subqueries are queries nested inside an ~SELECT~, ~INSERT~, ~DELETE~ or ~UPDATE~
  statement that return a set.
+ Also know as "inner queries".

* Subqueries as Expressions

** Scalar Subquery
Results in a single row.

** Multi-Row Subquery
Results in multiple rows, tipically used in the where clause with operators such
as ~IN~, ~NOT~, ~EXISTS~, ~ANY~ and ~ALL~.

*** Correlated Subquery
A uncorrelated sub-query is a type of sub-query where the inner query doesnâ€™t
depend upon the outer query for its execution.

#+begin_src sql
  SELECT
    foo,
    (SELECT
      AVG(...)
     FROM B
     WHERE B.foo = A.foo) AS bar
  FROM A;
#+end_src

*** Uncorrelated Subquery
A correlated sub-query is a type of query where the inner query depends upon the
outcome of the outer query in order to perform its execution.

#+begin_src sql
  SELECT
    foo,
    (SELECT
      AVG(...)
     FROM B) AS bar
  FROM A;
#+end_src

* Subqueries as Tables

* Semi-Joins & Subquery Elimination

#+begin_quote
A semi-join between two tables R and S returns rows from table R for which there
is at least one row from table S with matching values in the joining columns.
