The computation model of OOP is the stateful model (...). The Ô¨Årst principle of
OOP is that programs are collections of interacting data abstractions. (...)
. Object-oriented programming brings order into this variety. It posits two
principles for building data abstractions:

1. Data abstractions should be stateful by default. Explicit state is important
   because of program modularity. It makes it possible to write programs as
   independent parts that can be extended without changing their interfaces.

2. The object (PDA) style of data abstraction should be the default. The object
   style is important because it encourages polymorphism and inheritance.
