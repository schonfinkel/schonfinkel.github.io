#+title: PropEr

PropEr is a tool for the automated, semi-random, property-based testing of
[[id:de7d0e94-618f-4982-b3e5-8806d88cad5d][Erlang]] and [[id:8d568d81-9c22-4d94-81b2-27a2d730ba98][Elixir]] programs.

* Foundations of Property-Based Testing

#+begin_quote
If example-based testing helps ensure that code does what we expect,
[[id:3793eb94-34f8-4195-b74a-bc28c771d973][Property-Based Testing]] forces the exploration of the programâ€™s behavior to see
what it can or cannot do, helping find whether our expectations were even right
to begin with. In fact, when we test with properties, the design and growth of
tests requires an equal part of growth and design of the program itself.
