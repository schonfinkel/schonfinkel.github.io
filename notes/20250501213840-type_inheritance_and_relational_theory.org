* Background

** A Fundamental Concept

#+begin_quote
$T′$ is a subtype of type $T$ if and only if, both of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. Every value of type $T′$ is a value of type $T$ (i.e., “$T′$ is a subset of $T$”).
2. A value of type T is a value of type T′ if and only if it satisfies a certain
   constraint, where the constraint in question is such that it can be tested
   for any given value of type T by examining just those properties that are
   intrinsic to values of type T in general.
