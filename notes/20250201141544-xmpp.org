* Definition

#+begin_quote
The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for
real-time communication, using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the base
format for exchanging information. In essence, XMPP provides a way to send small
pieces of XML from one entity to another in close to real time.

The important thing to realize about XMPP is that rather than being a set of software, *it is a
set of standards that define how clients and servers should interact*, much like HTTP is a
standard rather than a specific piece of software like Apache.

+ Decentralized
+ Secure
+ Scalable
+ Real-Time
+ Multi-Device
