#+title: Gen StateM

#+begin_quote
Beware of the common beginner error where instead of using a generic FSM, you
use a [[id:1cd8fd81-a7c4-44ea-8b7a-d803e9b491af][Gen Server]] and unknowingly store the FSM state in the loop data. Ask
yourself when designing the system whether you need an FSM or a client-server
behavior. The answer is usually obvious if you consider the question in the
design phase of the project.
