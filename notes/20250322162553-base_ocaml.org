Jane Street, a company that has been using [[id:3a8d5cf5-9b6c-4995-b7f0-b2218e52bd01][OCaml]] for more than 20 years, developed
the code in ~Base~ for its own internal use, but from the start designed it with an eye
toward being a general-purpose standard library. Like the OCaml language itself, Base
is engineered with correctness, reliability, and performance in mind.
