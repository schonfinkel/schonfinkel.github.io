* Functional Design

#+begin_quote
A functional interface for communication between two subsystems can be
implemented as an algebraic data type and an interpreter. Or it can be encoded
as a state machine. Or it can be monadic. Or it could be built with type
classes. (...) The functional paradigm also introduces a new principle of
software design: finding the essence of some domain means finding its
mathematical invariants, which then can be emphasized to get the correct
behavior of the domain as a consequence. [cite:@granin2024 p.18]
