* Pivot
Allows you to rotate a table so that rows become columns


* Data Cubes

#+begin_quote
The generalization of a *cross-tab*, which is two-dimensional, to n dimensions can
be visualized as an n-dimensional cube, called the *data cube*. (...) . Each cell
in the data cube contains a value, just as in a *cross-tab*. (...) . All cells
contain values, even if they are not visible. The value for a dimension may be
*all*, in which case the cell contains a summary over *all values* of that
dimension, as in the case of *cross-tabs*.
