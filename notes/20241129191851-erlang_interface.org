[[id:de7d0e94-618f-4982-b3e5-8806d88cad5d][Erlang]] communicates with external programs through objects called ports. If we
send a message to a port, the message will be sent to the external program
connected to the port. Messages from the external program will appear as Erlang
messages that come from the ports.

(...)

Note the difference between using a port to communicate with an external process
and a socket. If you use a port, the port will behave like an Erlang process, so
you can link to it, send messages to it from a remote distributed Erlang node,
and so on. If you use a socket, it will not behave like a
process. [cite:@armstrong2013 p.232]
