~ffmpeg~ is a universal media converter. It can read a wide variety of inputs -
including live grabbing/recording devices - filter, and transcode them into a
plethora of output formats.

~ffmpeg~ reads from an arbitrary number of inputs (which can be regular files,
pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the ~-i~ option, and
writes to an arbitrary number of outputs, which are specified by a plain output
url. Anything found on the command line which cannot be interpreted as an option
is considered to be an output url.[fn:1]
