* Basic Concepts

#+begin_quote
A category *C* consists of

+ a collection C_0, whose elements are called the /objects/ of *C* and are usually
  denoted by uppercase letters, *X*, *Y*, *Z*, ...;
+ a collection C_1, whose elements are called the /morphisms/, or /arrows/, of *C* and
are usually denoted by lowercase letters, *f*, *g*, *h*, ...;

such that

+ each morphism is assigned two objects, called *source* and *target*, or *domain* and
  *codomain*. We denote the *source* and *target* of the *morphism* /f/ by /s(f)/ and /t(f)/,
  respectively. If the *morphism* /f/ has *source* *S* and *target* *T*, we also write $f :
  X \rightarrow Y$, or, more graphically $X \xrightarrow{f} Y$,

+ each object *X* has a distinguished morphism $id_X: X \rightarrow X$, called identity
  morphism.

+ for each pair of morphisms /f/, /g/, with t(f) = s(g), there exists a specified
  morphism $g \circ f$, called the *composite morphism*, such that $s(g \circ f) = s(f)$ and
  $t(g \circ f) = t(g)$. 

These structures need to satisfy the following axioms:

+ *Unitality:* For every morphism $f: X â†’ Y$, the compositions $f \circ id_X$ and $id_Y \circ f$
  are both equal to /f/.

+ *Associativity*: For $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $g: Y \rightarrow Z$ and $h: Z \rightarrow W$, the compositions $h \circ (g \circ
  f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$.
