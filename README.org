An Org-based personal webpage, blog, zettelkasten garden and LaTeX CV
builder. The idea behind this project is unify all of my note-taking and
blogging in a single place, and also leverage Nix to make the whole experience
seamless.

** Usage

*** Development

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  nix develop
  # followed by an initial setup
  just sync
#+END_SRC

*** Build & Publish

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  build
#+END_SRC

** Org Roam

The org roam graph generation is a modification from [[https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/][Hugo Cisnero's Notes
Workflow]]. You can generate the current graph from you local database instance by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  graph
  # or
  just graph
#+END_SRC

inside the Nix shell.
