While this is a click bait title (maybe I've also farmed some zoomer credits out
the OC), I'm pretty sure that's how Don Syme feels when looks at a [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results][Result]] type
like ~Result<'T,string>~ in an F# codebase. The reason why I've written this post
is that I started doing changes in a [[https://github.com/schonfinkel/interval.fs][open source project]] I develop/maintain,
and realized other .Net people could benefit from this somehow (as most of the
Nix + .Net guides are from before 2024).

Turns out that, while writing this, I've decided to put everything in a template
that's easy to +steal+ copy, so if you are from the future and have the [[https://nixos.org/download/][Nix (the
package manager)]] and the [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Flakes]] feature enabled you'll be able to reproduce this
post. Additionally, someone beat me into writing a flake for F#, here's [[https://github.com/NixOS/templates/tree/master/dotnet][a more
official take]] on it, there are a couple changes from my repo and this one,
mostly because I tend to favor devenv (since it has shown better adoption when I
preached it to non-Nixers).

** Devenv
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       73b53fca-6c55-4e5f-bfc6-741d3c500561
:END:

I've already tackled this in a [[https://schonfinkel.github.io//blog/20240907-experiments_with_erlang_and_nix.html][previous article]], but the best developer
experience right now is with [[https://devenv.sh/][devenv.sh]]. Unlike the previous article tho, the
environment setup is way simpler, just a bunch of .Net tools inside the shell
and call it a day.

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  #(...)
  # `nix develop --impure`
  default = devenv.lib.mkShell {
    inherit inputs pkgs;
    modules = [
      (
        { pkgs, lib, ... }:
        {
          packages = with pkgs; [
            bash
            just

            # for dotnet
            netcoredbg
            fsautocomplete
            fantomas
          ];

          languages.dotnet = {
            enable = true;
            package = dotnet;
          };

          # looks for the .env by default additionaly, there is .filename
          # if an arbitrary file is desired
          dotenv.enable = true;
        }
      )
    ];
  };
  # (...)
#+END_SRC

and similary to the previous post, we can access the environment by doing:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix develop --impure
#+END_SRC

or, if you have [[https://github.com/direnv/direnv][direnv]], run ~direnv allow~. Now you can build the project with the
usual .Net tooling:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  dotnet build
  # There is also a justfile configured to you can just
  # type "just" and get all commands
#+END_SRC

Here's a quick demo:

** Build your project with Nix
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bae951a2-6b73-412f-99ed-9087b594ffa7
:END:

This project is just a simple solution with the basic [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-command-line][CLI Console App]] from the
official documentation, the difference being that I've added a dependency to
[[https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling][FsToolkit.ErrorHandling]], just as a way to showcase how to handle nuget
dependencies later. To package your .Net App there is already the [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/doc/languages-frameworks/dotnet.section.md#packaging-a-dotnet-application-packaging-a-dotnet-application][buildDotNetModule]],
you can explore all the other options later in the docs, this is what works for
the current code:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  # `nix build`
  default = pkgs.buildDotnetModule {
    pname = name;
    version = version;
    src = ./.;
    projectFile = "src/App/App.fsproj";
    nugetDeps = ./deps.nix;

    dotnet-sdk =
      with pkgs.dotnetCorePackages;
      combinePackages [
        sdk_8_0
      ];
    dotnet-runtime = pkgs.dotnetCorePackages.sdk_8_0;
  };
#+END_SRC

To properly build this with nix, you may have noticed that we also import a
~deps.nix~ file in the previous step. This file contains all the nuget
dependencies our project uses and their hashes:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  { fetchNuGet }: [
    (fetchNuGet { pname = "FsToolkit.ErrorHandling"; version = "4.16.0"; hash = "sha256-4pRixOtRDgLt4/z71o1XnkuXRa/43LUhl/pDRpofX7s="; })
  ]
#+END_SRC

You don't have to manually create or edit this, as its already documented
[[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/doc/languages-frameworks/dotnet.section.md#generating-and-updating-nuget-dependencies-generating-and-updating-nuget-dependencies][here]]. In this project this is already handled by the ~just gen-deps~ (or ~just gd~)
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ rm deps.nix
  $ just gd      
  dotnet restore --packages out
    Determining projects to restore...
    All projects are up-to-date for restore.
  nix run nixpkgs#nuget-to-nix -- out > deps.nix
  $ cat deps.nix               
  { fetchNuGet }: [
    (fetchNuGet { pname = "FsToolkit.ErrorHandling"; version = "4.16.0"; hash = "sha256-4pRixOtRDgLt4/z71o1XnkuXRa/43LUhl/pDRpofX7s="; })
  ]
#+END_SRC

The previous step is also the usual way to update a .Net package in nixpkgs, most
times you'll just need to get the new version hash and update the nuget hashes
as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cd <my-clone-of-nixpkgs>
  $ nix-build -A <package-name>.passthru.fetch-deps | bash
  $ nix-build -A <package-name>
#+END_SRC

Then you open a PR to the [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs][official repository]], following the [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md][contribution
guidelines]], of course. Now, going back to the testing the Nix build:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ nix build                                                    
  $ ./result/bin/App 
  Test
  # It works
#+END_SRC

** Generating OCI Images
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ecdf166e-2ec7-4daa-9026-1378bc2a3665
:END:

Similar to the [[https://schonfinkel.github.io//blog/20240907-experiments_with_erlang_and_nix.html][previous post]], the Container Image looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # nix build .#dockerImage
  dockerImage = pkgs.dockerTools.buildLayeredImage {
    name = "sample";
    tag = "latest";
    created = "now";
    contents = [ default ];
    config = {
      Cmd = [
        "${default}/bin/App"
      ];
    };
  };
#+END_SRC

And can be tested with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ nix build .#dockerImage
  $ docker load < ./result
  $ docker container run --rm sample:latest
  Test
#+END_SRC

If this sparkled your interest somehow, here's the [[https://github.com/schonfinkel/fsharp-nix/tree/master][source code]], I've also made
sure to configure some [[https://github.com/schonfinkel/fsharp-nix/actions][Github Actions]] Workflows there. 

** TODO
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cf5648aa-f8a4-4210-9c0f-577c7ffd77da
:END:
- [ ] Optimize the container image, by just shipping the runtime, not the SDK.
- [ ] Open a PR into the [[https://github.com/NixOS/templates/tree/master/dotnet][NixOS Templates]] repo, maybe adding a [[https://safe-stack.github.io/][SAFE]] stack example
  as well and a container build into the Hello Example.
