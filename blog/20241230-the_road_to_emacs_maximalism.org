Iâ€™ve stumbled across a method of composing programs that excites me very
much. In fact, my enthusiasm is so great that I must warn the reader to discount
much of what I shall say as the ravings of a fanatic who thinks he has just seen
a great light. [cite:@knuth1984literate p.1]

* Introduction

A couple years ago I've started watching [[https://github.com/sponsors/daviwil][David Wilson's]] channel (also know as
[[https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][SystemCrafters]]), originally his channel focused heavilly on[[https://fsharp.org/][ F#]] (and that's how I
found him), but eventually he started posting more and "GNU slash Emacs"
content. I lost interest on the channel at the time, while he did indeed
showcase a level of productivity that was way above what I had, I felt like it
could be easily emulated with a combination of ~Neovim~ and some other Linux
tools.

Everything changed once I saw his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyhPmypHDEw][presentation]] about of [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]], my brain got
hijacked by the idea of testing ~Emacs~. I had previously heard about [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode]]
before, but it was never on my radar since it felt like some [[https://xkcd.com/378/]["Emacs weirdo"]]
cool-aid. What got me impressed was that I always needed some tool to help me
organize my notes (specially during college where most of my annotations got
lost). To fill this gap, such a tool would need to have the following
properties:

1. Document everything that I've done.
2. Register and link everything that I've read, preferably by integrating:
   + Text
   + Math
   + Code
   + Citations
3. Manage and track figures, while maintaing referential integrity.
4. Be free (as in freedom) or open source.

Obsidian tickles most of these (if you consider its plugins), but the [[https://obsidian.md/license][license]] is
a little bit worrying and you can bet they will pull an [[https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/6577][insomnia]] in the
future. [[https://github.com/logseq/logseq][Logseq]] is a much better alternative in this regard, plus you have the
option of using something much better than ~markdown~ or ~reStructuredText~, and that
is ~org~.

  #+begin_quote
  (...) trivial usage of *Org-mode* is nothing more than text editing, from which
  point the user can start to add special plain text *Org-mode* elements to the
  document. *Org-mode* is therefore easy to adopt and aims to be a general solution
  for authoring projects with mixed computational and natural languages. It
  supports multiple programming languages, export targets, and work flows.
  [cite:@schulte2012multi p.2]
  #+end_quote

Org is a major[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Modes.html][ mode]] in Emacs, it is also a powerful markup language and I would
argue a better tool than any of the current alternatives. If properly
configured, ~orgmode~ can combine writing, planning, scheduling, linking and
programming into a cohesive workflow.

#+begin_quote
*Org-mode* extends *Emacs* with a simple and powerful markup language that turns it
into a language for creating, parsing, and interacting with
hierarchically-organized text documents. Its rich feature set includes text
structuring, project management, and a publishing system that can export to a
variety of formats. Source code and data are located in active blocks, distinct
from text sections, where "active" here means that code and data blocks can be
evaluated to return their contents or their computational results. The results
of code block evaluation can be written to a named data block in the document,
where it can be referred to by other code blocks, any one of which can be
written in a different computing language. In this way, an *Org-mode* buffer
becomes a place where different computer languages communicate with one
another. Like *Emacs*, *Org-mode* is extensible: support for new languages can be
added by the user in a modular fashion through the definition of a small number
of *Emacs Lisp* functions.

** Literate Programming

#+begin_quote
I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of
programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be works
of literature. Hence, my title: "Literate Programming."
[cite:@knuth1984literate p.1]
#+end_quote

I must admit that, even though the idea itself seems interesting, time has
proven that "literate programming" the way Knuth is suggesting is impractical,
but lets forgive him, it was 1984. When it comes to documentation, I would
rather deal with a good type system (like the ones inpired by the ML-family of
languages) and/or have proper documentation tooling ([[https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/docs-tests-and-with.html#doctests][hexdocs]] is the gold
standard as far as I could experience).

I'm emphasizing this because [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org-babel]] (which is part of ~org-mode~) is a
practical tool to make ~Emacs~ a literate programming environment.

#+begin_quote
Borrowing terms from the literate programming literature, ~Org-mode~ supports both
*weaving* - the exportation of a mixed code/prose document to a format suitable
for reading by a human - and *tangling* - the exportation of a mixed code/prose
document to a pure code file suitable for execution by a
computer. [cite:@schulte2012multi p.12]
#+end_quote

* Orgmode


** Arbitrary Code Execution and Generation

Here's what my ~blog.org~ file looks like:

#+begin_src org
    Here you'll find my latest content, projects, tutorials and ramblings.

    ,#+header: :exports results
    ,#+header: :results html
    ,#+NAME: export-posts
    ,#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    dotnet fsi posts.fsx
    ,#+END_SRC
#+end_src

it's a single line that also calls a shell command, ~dotnet fsi posts.fsx~,
~posts.fsx~ in an ~F#~ file that generates html content as a huge string:

#+begin_src shell
  $ dotnet fsi posts.fsx 

      <div class="stub">
        <h2>
          <a href="./blog/20241231-the_road_to_emacs_maximalism.html"> The road to Emacs maximalism </a>
        </h2>
        <small>2024-12-31</small>
      </div>
      

      <div class="stub">
        <h2>
          <a href="./blog/20240916-you_have_10_seconds_to_nixify_your_dotnet_project.html"> You have 10 seconds to nixify your dotnet project </a>
        </h2>
        <small>2024-09-16</small>
      </div>

      # And so on...
#+end_src

This could have been done in any language really, but I felt more comfortable
quickly pulling this in ~F#~, the ~#+header: :results html~ makes sure this will be
correctly exported to ~html~ once we run the ~publish.el~ file (either locally on in
CI). 

** Roam

Similar to the previous section, my [[https://schonfinkel.github.io/notes.html][notes]] are also generated via some hacky ~F#~
script:

#+begin_src org
  This is the place where I dump my [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org ROAM]] notes.

  ,#+INCLUDE: ./static/html/graph.html export html

  ,#+header: :exports results
  ,#+header: :results html
  ,#+NAME: export-posts
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    dotnet fsi notes.fsx
  ,#+END_SRC
#+end_src

The difference being that there is an extra ~#+INCLUDE:~ directive importing
actual html code. That's where the ~d3.js~ graph setup is.

*** Stealing the Graph

#+CAPTION: My crappy graph
#+NAME:   fig:the-graph
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70% :align center
[[file:../static/img/the_road_to_emacs_maximalism/notes.png]]

I've blatantly copied from Hugo Cisnero's [[https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/][awesome blogpost]] a couple years ago
and I really like how he generated a graph out of the ~sqlite~ db already used by
~org-roam~. Some minimal changes were required to render my graph, it is sparser
than his, so forcing a minimum number of communites doesn't look that good (a
quick hack is taking the number of [[https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.components.weakly_connected_components.html#networkx.algorithms.components.weakly_connected_components][weakly connected components]]). To build the
graph one just needs to run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  just graph
  # or
  graph
  # inside the Nix shell
#+END_SRC

Note that this used to be an [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui/discussions/109#discussioncomment-8272050][feature request]] on Github, until someone created a
[[https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-org-roam-ui][publish-org-roam-ui]] github action. Maybe that's what most people need, but it
won't work for me, at least in this current iteration of the blog.

** Diagrams as Code

For my current needs ~graphviz~ is enough, but I can keep adding similar
tools later:

#+header: :exports both
#+NAME: graphviz-example
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file ../static/img/the_road_to_emacs_maximalism/graphviz_example.png :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng
  digraph {
    a -> b;
    b -> c;
    c -> a;
  }
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: graphviz-example
[[file:../static/img/the_road_to_emacs_maximalism/graphviz_example.png]]

** Exports

You take an org file and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing-options.html][export it]] to different formats like: ~html~ (that's how
this blog is made), ~LaTeX~, ~markdown~, etc. Currently I only care about the ~html~
export and you can find the ~publish.el~ file [[https://github.com/schonfinkel/schonfinkel.github.io/blob/master/publish.el][here.]]

* The Infrastructure

Knuth has a point about some of the portability issues on his "Literate
Programming" paper, even though the markup language (~WEB~) was portable to
different systems, the same could not be said of the ~PASCAL~ compilers that were
generating the code:

#+begin_quote
Furthermore, many of the world's PASCAL compilers are incredibly
bizarre. Therefore it is quite naive to believe that a single program TANGLE.PAS
could actually work on very many different machines, or even that one single
source file TANGLE.WEB could be adequate; some system-dependent changes are
inevitable. [cite:@knuth1984literate p.10]
#+end_quote

Technically, any modern literate programming environment (heck any programming
environment in general) is going to suffer from similar issues (instead of
multiple compilers we have multiple package managers and DLL hell). If you use a
~python~ notebook and never bothered to pin your dependencies, or worse, if no one
knows which version of the interpreter was used initially, then give it a couple
months and there's a pretty good chance it will never run.

** Nix

To make this less likelly to happen, my development environment heavilly relies
on [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] and [[https://devenv.sh/][devenv]]. Everything is set in a single [[https://github.com/schonfinkel/schonfinkel.github.io/blob/master/flake.nix][flake.nix]] file, a ~LaTeX~
environment with a couple dependencis, some ~.NET~ and ~Python~ libs, ~sqlite~, [[https://github.com/casey/just][just]]
and even a custom ~Emacs~ to be used in CI, this might seem cursed but it's really
easy to pull this off on Nix:

#+begin_src nix
  # (...)
  customEmacs = (pkgs.emacsPackagesFor pkgs.emacs-nox).emacsWithPackages (
    epkgs:
    with epkgs.melpaPackages;
    [
      citeproc
      htmlize
      ox-rss
    ]
    ++ (with epkgs.elpaPackages; [
      org
      org-roam
      org-roam-ui
    ])
  );
  # (...)
#+end_src

this is only used the CI shell, where we require ~Emacs~ with a minimum set of
plugins to publish the website, the default (impure) development shell is still
going to pull your local Emacs:

#+begin_src nix
  {
    # `nix develop .#ci`
    # Reduce the number of packages to the bare minimum needed for CI,
    # by removing LaTeX and not using my own Emacs configuration, but
    # a custom package with just enough tools for org-publish.
    ci = pkgs.mkShell {
      ENVIRONMENT = "prod";
      OUT_URL = "https://schonfinkel.github.io/";
      DOTNET_ROOT = "${dotnet}";
      DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT = "1";
      LANG = "en_US.UTF-8";
      buildInputs = [ dotnet customEmacs ] ++ tooling;
    };

    # `nix develop --impure`
    # This is the development shell, meant to be used as an impure
    # shell, so no custom Emacs here, just use your global package
    # switch back to the CI shell for builds.
    default = devenv.lib.mkShell {
      inherit inputs pkgs;
      modules = [
        (
          { pkgs, lib, ... }:
          {
            packages = [ dotnet texenv ] ++ tooling;

            env = {
              ENVIRONMENT = "dev";
              DOTNET_ROOT = "${dotnet}";
              DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT = "1";
              LANG = "en_US.UTF-8";
            };

            scripts = {
              build.exec = "just build";
              graph.exec = "just graph";
              clean.exec = "just clean";
            };

            enterShell = ''
              echo "Starting environment..."
            '';
          }
        )
      ];
  };
#+end_src

the full setup can be found in the main [[https://github.com/schonfinkel/schonfinkel.github.io/blob/master/flake.nix][repo]].

** Continous Integration

Again, I benefit from a somewhat easy to setup CI pipeline thanks to
[[https://github.com/cachix/install-nix-action][install-nix]], it's a copy of what I already do locally. And you can also benefit
from faster builds with the [[https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache][magic-nix-cache]].

#+begin_src yaml
      - name: Install Nix
        uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v27

      - name: Install Nix Cache
        uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@main

      - name: Build website
        run: |
          mkdir -p "$HOME/.emacs.d/"
          touch "$HOME/.emacs.d/.org-id-locations"
          nix develop .#ci -c just build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
#+end_src


** What is Still Missing

- Anki-Like Flashcards: With either [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html\\][org-drill]] or [[https://www.leonrische.me/fc/index.html][org-fc]].

- Integration with [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]]: ~org-ref~ offers a suite of tools that would make
  keeping track of references easier as the number of notes and posts increases.

- Remove some of the Polyglot Templating: Although the polyglot usage of
  different programming languages here was a good way to show some of orgmode's
  source block features, I know my usage of ~F#~ is unecessary, I could have done
  the same in pure ~elisp~, but I still suck at it.

- Not related to the blog itself, but [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][org-agenda]] looks slick.

* Notable Mentions

** Hugo

This blog was originally fully integrated with[[https://gohugo.io/][ hugo]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] (first stolen
from [[https://github.com/ratsclub][my close friend]]), but eventually I've started facing issues since the way I
organize files (one per post) is not recommended by ox-hugo. The "per-post"
setup actually worked, but ~hugo~ is also a project that moves very fast and I
quickly faced a situation where upgrading it broke my workflow, luckily I
develop in a sandbox environment and was able to ignore this versioning issue
for a couple months.

** Quartz

Similar to ~hugo~, although [[https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/][Quartz]] is also built to support [[https://obsidian.md/][Obsidian]]-like notes.

** Emanote

Before doing the full refactor and moving it back to a pure [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][org-publish]]
workflow, I found out about [[https://emanote.srid.ca/][emanote]]. It is similar to Quartz, but it feels
overall better since the license is ~AGPL v3~. It's also built atop of Markdown,
but there are [[https://github.com/srid/emanote/blob/master/docs/guide/orgmode.org][steps]] on how to configure this to use ~org~ as well. May be a good
choice for people already familiar with Haskell and Nix.

* Conclusion

While I haven't moved all my development workflow to ~Emacs~ (it might be a matter
a time), ~Emacs~ already stole all my note-taking and blogging capabilities and
I'll probably stick with it for a long time. I still hope ~Neovim~ gets something
similar, it is already a huge improvement above vanilla ~vim~ offered thanks to
many new features (and allowing a [[https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html][real language]] for configuration instead of
~VimL~). There is also some work being done in [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode][replicating org]] using ~lua~, but it
would be interesting to see if the community can pull some similar plugins as
well.
